# Kidcentral Analytics Dashboard

Kidcentral Analytics Dashboard is a secure, company‑wide analytics application that exposes operational data to managers and team members. Built with a fast Vite‑powered React frontend and a Python service behind PocketBase authentication, it delivers live charts and tables that help the business make data‑driven decisions. The dashboard provides role‑based access control, ensuring that sensitive information is shared appropriately while still being easy to use. Key features include:

- **Secure authentication** – PocketBase handles user sign‑ups, logins and permissions, while the Python backend serves pre‑processed analytics data.
- **Fast user experience** – a Vite + React UI renders charts and tables quickly, allowing managers to drill into sales and inventory metrics without delays.
- **Scalable architecture** – the separation of frontend and backend components enables independent scaling and simplifies maintenance.
- **Actionable insights** – real‑time data visualizations make it easy to spot trends, anomalies and growth opportunities.

This project demonstrates how modern web technologies can turn raw business data into operational intelligence. It lays the groundwork for further enhancements such as self‑service reporting and predictive analytics.
