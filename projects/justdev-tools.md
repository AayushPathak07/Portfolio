# JustDev.tools

JustDev.tools is a collection of lightweight, privacy‑first utilities designed to eliminate context switching during development. Built as an installable progressive web app, it runs entirely in your browser and continues to work offline after the first visit. There are no accounts, no servers and no data leaves your device, making it both fast and dependable. The toolbox exists because developers frequently need to format payloads, decode tokens, generate hashes or test regular expressions without leaving their current task.

## Features

- **Data conversion** – convert between JSON, YAML, XML, CSV and perform URL encoding/decoding and base64/hex transforms.
- **Generation & verification** – create UUIDs, hashes, checksums, lorem ipsum text, timestamps and slugs.
- **Security helpers** – decode JWT tokens, inspect HTTP headers and redact sensitive payloads.
- **Content tools** – diff, prettify or minify text; change case; and clean CSVs.
- **Media & testing** – resize images, generate QR/barcodes, test regex patterns, build HTTP requests and perform time/date calculations.

## Privacy and Performance

All operations are executed in memory on the client; nothing is uploaded and there is no analytics. The app is pre‑cached so it launches instantly and works offline, providing a native‑like experience when installed on desktop or mobile. It favors keyboard shortcuts and maintains minimal state, allowing you to paste, transform and move on quickly.

JustDev.tools demonstrates that productivity apps don’t need to compromise on privacy to be effective. It’s a trustworthy companion that saves seconds every day without asking for anything in return.
