# Directus → Next.js UI Kit

To speed up development of content‑driven web apps, this project converts a Directus data model into fully typed Next.js components. Given a Directus schema, it generates reusable UI components along with TypeScript type definitions and Zod validation schemas【835914650520473†L47-L52】. This allows developers to scaffold CRUD interfaces quickly while maintaining strong type safety. Key benefits include:

- **Automated scaffolding** – reduces repetitive coding by creating forms, lists and detail views directly from the schema.
- **Type safety** – generated TypeScript types ensure that data passed between the client and API aligns with the underlying database structure【835914650520473†L47-L52】.
- **Validation** – Zod schemas guard against invalid inputs at runtime, improving reliability.
- **Customization** – developers can extend or override generated components to fit specific UI requirements.

By turning metadata into code, the Directus → Next.js UI Kit shortens the feedback loop between data modelling and user interface.
