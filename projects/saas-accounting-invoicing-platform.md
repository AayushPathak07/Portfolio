# SaaS Accounting & Invoicing Platform

This project is a cloud‑based accounting and invoicing solution designed for small businesses. It provides a modern user experience for creating invoices, tracking payments and managing a ledger, all built on top of a Next.js frontend and a Postgres database. To support ongoing development, the platform adopts pragmatic CI/CD and observability practices, ensuring that updates are delivered quickly and reliably. Key aspects include:

- **Fast invoicing workflows** – generate professional invoices in seconds and track their status across the client lifecycle.
- **Clean ledger management** – maintain an organized record of transactions and automatically reconcile payments.
- **Modern tech stack** – Next.js offers server‑side rendering and API routes, while Postgres provides transactional integrity.
- **Infrastructure** – built with CI/CD pipelines and monitoring to catch issues early and roll out features without downtime.

As an ongoing freelance project, the platform demonstrates how web technologies can simplify financial operations for small businesses.
