# Kidcentral Realsense Dimensioner

Kidcentral Realsense Dimensioner is a Windows desktop tool that captures the physical dimensions of objects using Intel RealSense depth cameras. Leveraging C#, OpenCV and the Intel RealSense SDK, the application measures length, width and height from depth data and packages the results into a user‑friendly interface【835914650520473†L19-L24】. Highlights of the project include:

- **Depth‑camera integration** – the tool streams point‑cloud data from Intel RealSense cameras and processes it in real time.
- **Accurate measurement** – OpenCV algorithms calculate dimensions and compensate for camera distortion and perspective.
- **Reliable deployments** – packaged installers make it easy to deploy the software across the organization for consistent performance【835914650520473†L19-L24】.
- **Use cases** – warehouse staff can quickly dimension packages for shipping, and product teams can measure prototypes without specialized hardware.

By combining computer‑vision techniques with off‑the‑shelf hardware, this project provides a cost‑effective alternative to expensive industrial dimensioning systems.
