# From Homelab to Production: Kidcentral DevOps Transformation

When Aayush joined Kidcentral Supply in 2023, the company’s IT environment relied heavily on SaaS providers and outsourced vendors【772994975756725†L13-L18】. Drawing on years of homelab experimentation, he proposed a shift toward building rather than buying. The transformation unfolded in several stages:

1. **Proof of concept** – by securely extracting ERP data and turning it into a small internal tool, he proved the value of building custom solutions【772994975756725†L35-L43】.
2. **Standing up infrastructure** – a modest on‑prem server with virtualization and a proxy layer formed the foundation for internal services【772994975756725†L37-L78】.
3. **Deployments and automation** – containerization, scheduled jobs and event‑driven triggers turned manual processes into self‑sufficient workflows【772994975756725†L85-L98】.
4. **Monitoring and incident management** – external monitoring and integrated incident reporting improved reliability and visibility【772994975756725†L103-L115】.
5. **Custom apps and integrations** – secure dashboards and reusable internal systems replaced costly outsourced e‑commerce integrations, cutting expenses and accelerating deployments【772994975756725†L119-L133】.

The results were dramatic: costs dropped, deployment cycles shrank from months to days, managers gained real‑time dashboards and the culture shifted from “buy first” to “build first”【772994975756725†L137-L151】. This project illustrates how homelab lessons can have real‑world impact when applied with discipline and curiosity.
