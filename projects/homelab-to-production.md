# From Homelab to Production: Kidcentral DevOps Transformation

When Aayush joined Kidcentral Supply in 2023, the company’s IT environment relied heavily on SaaS providers and outsourced vendors. Drawing on years of homelab experimentation, he proposed a shift toward building rather than buying. The transformation unfolded in several stages:

1. **Proof of concept** – by securely extracting ERP data and turning it into a small internal tool, he proved the value of building custom solutions.
2. **Standing up infrastructure** – a modest on‑prem server with virtualization and a proxy layer formed the foundation for internal services.
3. **Deployments and automation** – containerization, scheduled jobs and event‑driven triggers turned manual processes into self‑sufficient workflows.
4. **Monitoring and incident management** – external monitoring and integrated incident reporting improved reliability and visibility.
5. **Custom apps and integrations** – secure dashboards and reusable internal systems replaced costly outsourced e‑commerce integrations, cutting expenses and accelerating deployments.

The results were dramatic: costs dropped, deployment cycles shrank from months to days, managers gained real‑time dashboards and the culture shifted from “buy first” to “build first”. This project illustrates how homelab lessons can have real‑world impact when applied with discipline and curiosity.
