# React Native App

This React Native project aims to deliver a lean, fast mobile application that works across both iOS and Android devices. By sharing UI primitives and business logic, the app achieves consistent look and feel on different platforms【835914650520473†L65-L69】. The initial feature set focuses on core functionality while leaving room for rapid iteration as user feedback is gathered. Highlights include:

- **Cross‑platform codebase** – React Native enables the majority of the code to run on both platforms while still allowing platform‑specific enhancements.
- **Shared components** – reusable UI primitives promote consistency and reduce development time【835914650520473†L65-L69】.
- **Performance** – careful attention to state management and network requests ensures that the app feels responsive on a wide range of devices.
- **Scalability** – the architecture is designed to accommodate future features without major rewrites.

This project showcases the advantages of building native‑like experiences using a single JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
