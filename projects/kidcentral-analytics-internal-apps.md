# Kidcentral Analytics & Internal Apps

To give managers immediate access to operational insights, Aayush built secure dashboards powered by ERP and operational data【642612861762554†L24-L29】. These dashboards use role‑based access control so that each team sees only the information relevant to them【642612861762554†L24-L30】. By replacing outsourced e‑commerce integrations with reusable internal systems, the project reduced costs, improved transparency and cut deployment times from months to days【642612861762554†L24-L31】. The solution uses PocketBase for authentication, a Python/FastAPI backend and a React front end【642612861762554†L24-L33】.

Key benefits include:

- **Immediate insights** – live dashboards surface sales, inventory and operational metrics.
- **Rapid deployment** – new integrations can be deployed in minutes rather than months【642612861762554†L24-L31】.
- **Lower costs** – eliminating vendor fees and contracts saves money and increases control.
- **CI/CD pipeline** – automated testing and deployment ensure reliability and speed.

By internalizing analytics and integrations, the company gained control over its data and improved its ability to respond quickly to business needs.
