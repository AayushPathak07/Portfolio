# Side Projects & Observability

In addition to primary DevOps work, Aayush regularly experiments with side projects to improve observability and developer experience. These initiatives include building telemetry pipelines with Grafana and Prometheus for containerized services, automating preview environments and creating repeatable templates【642612861762554†L46-L53】. He also runs failure drills and plans progressive deployments to enhance reliability【642612861762554†L46-L53】.

Highlights:

- **Telemetry pipelines** – integrated dashboards provide insights into application and infrastructure health.
- **Preview environments** – automated environments enable teams to test changes before they reach production.
- **Reliability practices** – regular chaos drills and progressive rollout strategies reduce downtime and increase confidence.

These experiments help refine best practices and foster a culture of continuous improvement within the development team.
